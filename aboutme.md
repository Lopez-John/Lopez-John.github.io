Hi my name is John Lopez, and I am currently a student at Lambda School, currently learning to meet your Data science and Engineering needs:

- works great with Pandas, NumPy, and other Python libraries
- can create fascinating visualizations for clients and shareholders
- predict the future with Statistics and Machine Learning

What else do you need?

### My story

After graduating with Valencia college with an Associates degree in General Studies, I began my career in Customer Service. Wait...that's not Data Science. You're right! A few years into that career, I realized I wanted to make more of an impact in the companies I worked with. Having a natural ability to see relationships and making unseen connections, I decided to weaponize it for your company's benefit. Data Science allows me to enhance those abilities and more.
