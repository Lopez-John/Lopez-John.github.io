## Can we predict what ailment a strain of cannabis can help alleviate?

"Allows medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating medical conditions as determined by a licensed Florida physician". This is the first line of Amendment 2 of the 2016 election year, which expanded the current medical marijauana restricted from those who were terminallary ill and less than a year to live, to any with any debilitaring medical condition.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Florida_Amendment_2) It passed with 71% of the vote and there are currenlty 306,185 Medical Marijuana patients and I joined them this past summer.[2](https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/medical-marijuana-patient-numbers/)

After a car accident left me with a couple of hernidated discs, I met with a physician and received my Medical Marijuana Use Registry card 6 weeks later. I walked into a dispensary, plated in white and jade, and talked with budtender. After talking with him about my back pain, he suggested a strain that was supposed to help with back pain, and at first I took it at face value. Later, I couldn't help but wonder what made him suggest this specific strain? What qualities allowed him to determine that this was the best to help? So I decided to do some digging.

I scoured the internet with my limited skills and found that Kushy, a cannabis and dispensory directory, had uploaded their app's information on Github including a dataset dedicated to different strains of cannabis which was fairly comprehensive.[3](https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset) After some organizing, I was able to identify the different ailments each strain of cannabis could be prescribed to help, but it shorted the strains I had to work with from 9509 to 971. Not every strain listed had any ailments, maybe I'll be able to fill some of those at the end?
