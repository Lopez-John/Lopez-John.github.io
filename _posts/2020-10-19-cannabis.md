"Allows medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating medical conditions as determined by a licensed Florida physician". This is the first line of Amendment 2 of the 2016 election year, which expanded the current medical marijuana restricted from those who were terminally ill and less than a year to live, to any with any debilitating medical condition[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Florida_Amendment_2). It passed with 71% of the vote and there are currently 306,185 Medical Marijuana patients and I joined them this past summer.

After a fender bender left me with a couple of herniated discs, I met with a physician and received my Medical Marijuana Use Registry card 6 weeks later. I walked into a dispensary and talked with a budtender. After talking with him about my back pain, he suggested a strain called Apple Jacks, a Hybrid, that was meant to help with the pain and, at first, I took that suggestion at face value. Later, I couldn't help but wonder what made him believe this specific strain would be the best? What qualities allowed him to determine this quality? Can someone look at certain qualities of a strain and determine what ailment that strain can help alleviate? So I decided to do some digging.

I scoured the internet with my limited skills and found that Kushy, a cannabis and dispensary directory, had uploaded their app's information on Github including a dataset dedicated to different strains of cannabis which were fairly comprehensive.[3](https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset) After some organizing, I was able to identify the different ailments each strain of cannabis could be prescribed to help, but it shorted the number of strains I had to work with from 9509 to 971. Not every strain listed had any ailments, maybe I'll be able to fill some of those at the end?

The top four ailments were Depression, Stress, Insomnia, and Pain, which isn't surprising considering only 28% of Americans say they are managing stress well, almost half of Americans lay awake at night due to Stress and around 17.3 million American adults had at least one major depressive episode.[4](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/10/stress) [5](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml) I focused the rest of my research on those four ailments because it would yield more information to test against later on.

First I wanted to test against the effects the strains have, surely there would be an association between Stress and an effect like Relaxed. The 15 documented effects were: Focused, Relaxed, Happy, Uplifted, Energetic, Sleepy, Dry Mouth, Paranoid, Euphoric, Creative, Anxious, Talkative, Hungry, Tingly, and Aroused. The results were rather mixed. Depression only yielded statistical relationships between three effects: Energetic, Sleepy, Hungry. Pain had relationships with Relaxed, Sleepy, Energetic, and Paranoid. Insomnia did have the highest amount of relationships, with nine effects such as Sleepy and Relaxed, but as well, Energetic. There were no relationships between any of the effects and Stress. Not seeing a clear relationship between all the Ailment and Effects, I wanted to check the relationship of the 3 strain types: Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid.

A little background, there is a generally accepted truth about these strain types. Indica strains are considered physically sedating, that 'stuck to the couch', deep relaxing feeling. Sativa is more engaging and energizing, good for outgoing and social activities. Hybrids being a mix and balance of both. [6](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-differences-between-cannabis-types) Many consumers believe that this would be a good indicator about how they may help with different ailments, I and the budtender who I spoke with included. 

This yielded better results, as the top four ailments did have a relationship with strain type, but I wanted to take it further. Does the concensus about Indicas, Sativas, and Hybrids hold up?

I believe that it does. I see that Relaxed, and Sleepy strains are more likely to be Indica strains, while Energetic and Talkative are more likely to be Sativas. Hybrids do dominate every effect, unfortunately, the data does not give any information about the Indica/Sativa ratio of those. What one could do is look that the amount of Indicas to Sativas, and if a Hybrid you were looking at has a similar ratio, and determine if that strain will have that effect.

Going back to my original question, can someone look at certain qualities of a strain and determine what ailment that strain can help alleviate? Yes, they can. Knowing the effects a strain has, you would be to determine which strain type it is. Knowing the strain type, you can then know which ailment it would be able to help alleviate. While it was great that I was able to make this conclusion, I had issues with the data before I worked on it. I would have liked to know who determined the ailments and the effects for each strain, was it a budtender who prescribed them, or the customer to who used them? I would have also liked to look at the chemical composition of each strain such as terpenes and cannabinoids. Most of the strain had that information left out. That could be another route for the prediction of treatments without subjective descriptions.

With more states making cannabis more accessible and, hopefully, a future where it is federal decriminalized, I find it exciting to see an industry grow into what could be a gamechanger in therapeutic medicine.
