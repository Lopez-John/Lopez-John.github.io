"Allows medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating medical conditions as determined by a licensed Florida physician". This is the first line of Amendment 2 of the 2016 election year, which expanded the current medical marijauana restricted from those who were terminallary ill and less than a year to live, to any with any debilitaring medical condition.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Florida_Amendment_2) It passed with 71% of the vote and there are currenlty 306,185 Medical Marijuana patients and I joined them this past summer.[2](https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/medical-marijuana-patient-numbers/)

After a car accident left me with a couple of hernidated discs, I met with a physician and received my Medical Marijuana Use Registry card 6 weeks later. I walked into a dispensary, plated in white and jade, and talked with budtender. After talking with him about my back pain, he suggested a strain that was supposed to help with back pain, and at first I took it at face value. Later, I couldn't help but wonder what made him suggest this specific strain? What qualities allowed him to determine that this was the best to help? So I decided to do some digging.

I scoured the internet with my limited skills and found that Kushy, a cannabis and dispensory directory, had uploaded their app's information on Github including a dataset dedicated to different strains of cannabis which was fairly comprehensive.[3](https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset) After some organizing, I was able to identify the different ailments each strain of cannabis could be prescribed to help, but it shorted the strains I had to work with from 9509 to 971. Not every strain listed had any ailments, maybe I'll be able to fill some of those at the end?

The top four ailments were Depression, Stress, Insomnia and Pain, which isn't suprising considering only 28% of Americans say they are managing stress well, almost half of Americans lay awake at night due to Stress and around 17.3 million American adults had at least one major depressive episode.[4](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/10/stress) [5](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml) I focused the rest of my research on those four ailments because it would yield more information to test against later on.

First I wanted to test against the effects the strains have, surely there would be an association between Stress and an effect like Relaxed. The 15 documented effects were: Focused, Relaxed, Happy, Uplifted, Energetic, Sleepy, Dry Mouth, Paranoid, Euphoric, Creative, Anxious, Talkative, Hungry, Tingly and Aroused. The results were rather mixed. Depression only yielded statistical relationships between three effects: Energetic, Sleepy, Hungry. Pain had relationships with Relaxed, Sleepy, Energetic, and Paranoid. Insomnia did have the highest amount of relationships, with nine effects such as Sleepy and Relaxed, but as well, Energetic. There was no relationships between any of the effects and Stress. Not seeing a clear relationship between all the Ailment and Effects, I wanted to check the relationship of the 3 strain types: Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid.

A little background, there is a generally accepted truth about these strain types. Indica strains are considered physically sedating, that stuck to the couch, deeply relaxing feeling. Sativa is more engaging and energizing, good for outgoing and social activites. Hybrids being a mix and balance of both. [6](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-differences-between-cannabis-types) Many consumers believe that this would be a good indicator about how they may help with different ailments, I and the budtender who I spoke with included.

This yielded better results, as the top four ailments did have a relationship with strain type, with Insomnia being more clear what the relationship is than the others.
