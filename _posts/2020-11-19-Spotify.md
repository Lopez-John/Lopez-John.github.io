Music is a snapshot of emotion, much like a picture of the Grand Canyon, conveying feeling that we all hope can relate to. That is why it is so prevalent in all cultures. Of course, some genres of music are more prevalent than others and it gives me a curiosity. It led to Spotify's dataset of all of their music that can streamed, where each song is broken down to certain qualities, including popularity. That quality could be very important if learned to be predicted. A musician could write to include popular qualities. An agent could choose which musician to provide advertising resources. A record company could choose which song to campaign for a Grammy nomination. As a student of Data Science and machine learning could influence our lives in so many ways, and this is my attempt at proving that.

Taking a look at the data set, Spotify breaks down each song into the following categories

**Qualities**
*   Acousticness
*   Dancability
*   Energy
*   Duration in milliseconds
*   Instrumentalness
*   Valence(how positive or sad a song sounds)
*   Popularity(0-100)
*   Tempo
*   Liveness(how live the song is)
*   Loudness
*   Speechiness
*   Year
*   Mode(major or minor mode)
*   Explicit(whether there are explicit words)
*   Key
*   Release Date

**Identifiers**
*   Artists
*   ID(Spotify's own identifier)
*   Name

After some data cleaning, I did a quick model and at first glance the results were rather impressive. Using a Ridge regression on a validation set, it had beaten the baseline mean absolute error(17.569) by 9.9 points, with a r-sqaured value of .77. Pretty good, until I looked at the permutational importance and found that the year of release had by far the heaviest importance.

I believe that is an issue of accesibility, which in and of itself is a leaky feature. Even though the accessibility for the songs is the same now, through Spotify, there initial releases weren't. Songs released earlier, such as in the 30s or 40s, were less likely to be popular than released now, because they were less accesible back then. Even more so, those who listened to those songs are less likely to use Spotify to listen to them now.

Mitigating this issue involved removing the release date and year from modeling and spliting my data for training, validation and testing had to be done at random. This did lead to less reliability by way of score and mean absolute error, but I believe it is more reliably functional.

But the score was rather dreadful, so more changes had to be done.

I created new features from the data:
*   Number of artists involved
*   Month of release
*   Set the duration to minutes

And removed others:
*   Artists
*   Song name

I also changed the modeling from a ridge regreesion to Random Forest regressor. This type of model creates a number of decision trees and returns a mean/average of the results. After some tuning, the validation results were rather well.

The results on the test set were also similiar. The test mean absolute error was 9.96 with a R-squared score of .62. 

While that is the best I could do so far, I believe there were features I could have created from the that would have helped such as being able to give a higher importance to artists that were featured repeatedly with other artists. It maybe an imperfect model, but it worked at being example of how data and Data Science can shape our lives.
